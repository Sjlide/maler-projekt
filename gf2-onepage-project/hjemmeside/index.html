                <p>Getting the logo for the brand was a difficult thing for them, they had to have something that looked cool but also something that they themselves liked, they had many different logos to choose from. The chosen logo was made in 4 minutes by Lucas and was just an M and a triangle superimposed, it was simple and had everything they were missing and looking for.</p>

                <h2 class="thecatchtext">THE CATCH</h2>
                <p>They both saw that they lacked something, something that caught people's eyes and was their characteristic, that is, something that was special and made them different. They had a hard time at first, and
                    "in the beginning" lasted a long time. Because they didn't know what to come up with, or where what they came up with should go. So it was a bit of a down hill for them.</p>
